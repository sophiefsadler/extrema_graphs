# extrema_graphs

All notebooks contain the name of the function in the title (as well as the number of dimensions). 

Notebooks which have "edge_changes" in the title are ones where I repeated all the code but increased the arbitrary distance which decides which edges to include, and decreased the number of nodes along those edges.

The notebook with "norm_change" in the title has these edge changes, and also has the first test of using a different norm in the MDS reduction.
