# extrema_graphs

All important code used for extrema graph construction and plot generation is stored in the extrema_search.py file, while implementations of all benchmark functions are available in the functions.py file. These are then called in the Jupyter notebooks ([FUNCTION] Extrema Search.ipynb), where extrema graph visualisations are generated for each of the benchmark functions.

Two separate Jupyter notebooks generate LON images (lon.ipynb) and surface plots for the benchmark functions (surface_plots.ipynb).
